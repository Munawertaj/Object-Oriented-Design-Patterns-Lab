This is a simple Pet Foster Home System desgined to manage pets available for adoption and rescued pets.
This system allows users to perform the following operations:

1. Add a Pet for Adoption: We can add a new pet to the foster home. They provide details such as the pet's ID, species, name, and age. The pet is then made available for adoption and added to the adoption pet list.

2. Rescue a Pet: We can rescue a pet in need. They enter information about the rescued pet, including ID, species, name, and age. The rescued pet is added to the rescued pet list.

3. Add a Rescued Pet for Adoption: We can select a rescued pet from the rescued pet list and mark it as available for adoption. This action moves the pet from the rescued pet list to the adoption pet list.

4. Adopt a Pet: We can choose from the list of pets available for adoption and adopt a pet by entering its ID. The adopted pet is removed from the adoption pet list.
