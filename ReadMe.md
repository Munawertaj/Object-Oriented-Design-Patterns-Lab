## Lab Experiment List on Object Oriented Analysis and Design

1. Write a Java Program that demonstrate multiple interface/inheritance. You are free to choose application for demonstrating multiple interface/inheritance.
2. Write a Java program to demonstrate a PET management systemâ€”which can be PET shop, PET care, PET service. You have to follow appropriate object-oriented design concept to implement the tasks.

## Lab Experiment List on Design Pattern

3. Write a Java program to demonstrate the implementation of a facade design pattern for a Banking Service with Checking, Saving, and Investment modules.
4. Write a Java program to demonstrate the implementation of a composite design pattern by using an example with a building composed of generic housing structures.
5. Write a Java program to demonstrate the implementation of a proxy pattern for an online retail store with global distribution and warehousing.
6. Write a Java program to demonstrate the implementation of a decorator pattern for a web page, which might display complex behavior, such as only allowing access to authorized users, or splitting search results across multiple pages.
7. Write a Java program to demonstrate the implementation of a state design pattern for a vending machine functionality on purchasing items.
