## In this assignment I have implemented a Banking Service with Checking, Saving, and Investment modules using façade design pattern.

## Here a BankService class acts as a façade for Chequing, Saving, and Investment classes. As all three accounts implement the iAccount interface, the BankService class wraps the account interface and classes and presents a simpler “front” for the Customer client class.

## Here these steps are followed

1. Design the interface.
2. Implement the interface with one or more classes.
3. Create the façade class and wrap the classes that implement the interface.
4. Use the façade class to access the subsystem.
